Internal Target Volume (ITV) generated from 4D-CT to account for respiratory motion (ITV = GTV + respiratory motion). Planning Target Volume (PTV) is ITV + 0.5 cm margin for setup uncertainty. Dose fall-off tightly controlled outside PTV.",
    "techniqueSummary": "Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) utilizing multiple non-coplanar arcs to achieve highly conformal dose distribution with steep dose gradients, maximizing dose to tumor while minimizing to surrounding normal lung, chest wall, esophagus, and spinal cord. 10MV FFF energy used for faster treatment delivery and reduced dose scatter.",

      "Esomeprazole 40mg PO Daily (Consideration for PRN or scheduled if esophagitis develops post-RT - proactive discussion due to RUL location near esophagus)",
      "Consideration for short course of oral steroids (e.g., Prednisone taper) if radiation pneumonitis develops (delayed onset, ~2-6 months post-RT), to be managed by Pulmonology/Rad Onc.",

      "High dose per fraction; precision setup and minimal patient motion are critical. Daily CBCT for verification.",
      "Monitor for any subtle signs of chest wall pain or tenderness during setup or post-treatment, especially in later follow-ups (potential for rib fracture).",
      "Ensure patient understands to report any new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever/chills promptly (could indicate pneumonitis or infection).",
      "Reinforce deep breathing exercises and smoking cessation (even if quit, still crucial for lung health).",
      "Patient uses cane; assist with transfer to/from treatment couch as needed to prevent falls."
